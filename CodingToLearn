## To call unix commands from R
##

system("R CMD BATCH" ...) # <- calls the unix terminal to run commands. Can use a loop of these commands to run multiple scripts, maybe this results in a natual parallelization???

##
## Moving around in directories 
##

cd /file/path/name # <- changes file path

pwd # <- displays path 

ls # <- displays content in current directory

cd # <- moves to the home directory

cd ~ # <- moves to the home directory (~ represents the home directory)

cd - # <- returns to the previous directory

##
## Moving and renaming files and directories
##

mv /file/path/filename /new/file/path # <- move file from first path to second path

mv oldfilename newfilename # <- renames the file oldfilename to newfilename

mv oldfilename new/file/path/newfilename # <- moves the file to the new file path and renames the file newfilename

##
## Copying files
##

cp oldfilename newfilename # <- creates a copy of the file with a name newfilename

cp -r DirectoryName NewDirectoryName # <- copies the directory DirectoryName to the directory NewDirectoryName

##
## Removing Files
##

rm filename # <- removes filename !! File is permanently deleted !!

rm filename1 filename2 # <- removes both filenames !! File is permanently deleted !!
